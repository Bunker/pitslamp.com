Pay what you want is an experiment for me to see what my work is worth to a selection of my clients. 

The concept is rather simple, you book a pay what you want shoot packet, I deliver the results and you choose how much you want to pay for the package.

This option is only possible on a fixed package.

The “Pay what you want” package contains:

* A portrait shoot of 1 hour (business, casual, family, couple,…)
* on location (at home, work, in the park, …)
* All selected photos delivered digitally through dropbox

If you have questions about how this all works, you can check out the following blogposts [FAQ: I shoot, you decide][1] But if you have any other questions, contact me.

Book the shoot now by mailing me at [info@pitslamp.com][2] or call me at +32 486 36 29 61
