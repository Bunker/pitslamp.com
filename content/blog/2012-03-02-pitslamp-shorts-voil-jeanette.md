As I&#8217;m living in Aalst, which is kinda really famous for it&#8217;s carnival parade and &#8220;Voil Jeanette&#8221; parade. I could not pass up on the opportunity to go out there and shoot the &#8220;Voil Jeanette&#8221; parade with my Mamiya RB67.

There is a bit of controversy surrounding the Voil jeanetten parade, as there are a lot of transvestites taking part. This was never the purpose of the parade.
