Last night while I was experimenting with long exposures on film, I noticed a halo around the moon. I thought this to be a fairly unique phenomena so I rushed to get my digital camera.

It turned out to be a 22˚ halo around the moon, something that occurs more regularly, but I did never notice it before. You can read more about it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22°_halo" title="22˚ halo" rel="none">wikipedia</a>

Anyway as I took the photos, I thought I'd share them with you.
