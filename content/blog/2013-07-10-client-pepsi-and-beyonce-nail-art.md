Half may the pop artist Beyonc&eacute; was supposed to give 2 shows in Antwerp. For this event, the people of Pepsi launched a short campaign to promote Pepsi and their link to Beyonc&eacute;. They asked <a href="http://www.passionfornails.be" title="Passion for nails" rel="contact met">Rebecca Lal</a>, champion of Belgium in nail art to create a tutorial for painting the swirl of Pepsi on your own nails.

That's how I ended up in a very unfamiliar place on morning in April, to shoot the illustrative photos for the tutorial. The result is the flyer you see above.

It was a fun assignment to do and definitely a challenge to photograph.
