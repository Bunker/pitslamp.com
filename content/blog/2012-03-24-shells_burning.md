Last night while returning from an assignment with <a href="http://www.pietervanimpe.com" rel="friend met" title="Fotografie Van Impe">Pieter</a> we were instructed to leave the E-40 in Wetteren because of a fire at the reststop/gas station.

Curious and us both being photographers with my gear in the trunk we could not pass up on the opportunity to turn back and go shoot some photos. The above photo is one of them, you can find more on [Flickr][2].

This morning I sold the photos to Het Laatste Nieuws and they will be published in the paper of monday. That&#8217;s how I like to start the weekend.
