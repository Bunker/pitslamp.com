I&#8217;m converting all my portrait photography to film and a while ago I did a very short session with <a href="http://www.andylemaire.be" title="Photography Andy Lemaire" rel="contact met">Andy</a>, a fellow photographer. Andy was such a great subject to shoot that after 1 roll of 36 photos we already had several really good shots

I&#8217;ll be doing more of these short posts, to full fill my promise, I made a couple of posts back.
