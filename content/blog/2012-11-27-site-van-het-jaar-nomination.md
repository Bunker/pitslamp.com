Every year the Flemish computer magazine <a href="http://www.clickx.be" title="Clickx" rel="none">Clickx</a> organizes the &#8220;Site van het jaar&#8221; (Site of the year) election. Imagine my surprise when I received a notification that I was selected as one of the nominees for the category photography.

The contest itself is not very important to me, but it sure drives a lot of traffic to the Flemish counterpart of this site (<a href="http://www.pitslamp.be" title="Fotografie PitsLamp" rel="me">pitslamp.be</a>). It is free advertising for me, so why not enjoy the attention while it lasts.

I have no illusions of winning the contest, but I would be gratefull not to finish last. So if you have some time to spare, head over to <a href="http://www.sitevanhetjaar.be/stem.cfm" title="stem - site van het jaar" rel="none">sitevanhetjaar.be</a>, register with your e-mail, wait for a confirmation mail and select &#8220;pitslamp.be&#8221; in the category &#8220;Fotografie&#8221;.

**Also don't forget you can still book a portrait session and decide yourself how much it's worth: <a href="http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20121122_i-shoot-you-decide" title="I shoot, you decide" rel="me">more info</a>**
