During the summer of 2004 and 2005, I lived in Crete in a small village called Plakias or as the regular visitors call it Planet P. It's a small village on the south coast of Crete., it's magical and I lost part of my heart there.

Visitors of Plakias should know the 3 lies before going there:

  1. I'm not drinking tonight
  2. I'm leaving tomorrow
  3. I love you

During our visit at the end of April, beginning of May this year, I tried to capture the beauty of nature in a short time lapse. As we were on a vacation, I did not spend too much time capturing the time lapse sequences and I did not redo any part that looks a bit flickery. It was my first decent attempt at a time lapse video and all in all I'm very satisfied with the result. Enjoy

For the technical part, I used a 5d MKII on sraw setting combined with a tripod and a <a href="http://www.triggertrap.com" rel="none" title="Triggertrap, creative ways of triggering your camera">Triggertrap</a> dongle with triggertrap mobile on the iPhone. I edited the raw images with Lightroom and <a href="http://lrtimelapse.com" title="LRTimelapse | advanced Time Lapse photography made easy" rel="none">LRTimelapse</a>. The photo sequence was processed into a video with <a href="http://www.dayofthenewdan.com/projects/time-lapse-assembler-1/" title="Time Lapse assembler | Day of the new dan" rel="none">Time Lapse assembler</a> and the final editing was done in Final cut pro X.
