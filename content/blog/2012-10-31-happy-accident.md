Sometimes all you need to get great looking photos is a stupid mistake on your part. Let me explain that.

Last week, I was helping out a fellow photographer <a href="http://www.guntherfrans.be" title="Gunther Frans Photography" rel="contact met">Gunther Frans</a> during a portfolio shoot. As Gunther was working with a very experienced hungarian model, I asked if I could take some shots with my Mamiya RB67. I wanted to test some new film and try out the RB67 in a studio setting.

After finishing the roll of Rollei Retro 80S I unloaded the camera, licked the paper closing strip and threw it in my bag. Apparently due to the high temperature in Gunther&#8217;s studio, the closing strip came lose and when I got home, the roll was partially unravelled. I should have put it in it&#8217;s container, taped it shut and only take it out of the container in my darkbag. Off course I presumed the roll would be ruined but just for the heck of it, I developed it anyway.

As expected most of the roll was overexposed, but I managed to recover 4 images, of which 2 turned out absolutely great. Now I need to figure out a way to get consistent results with this kind of light leaks.
