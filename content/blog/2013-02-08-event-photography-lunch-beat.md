Yesterday, <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" title="SaraVdV: There are no endings, only new beginnings" rel="muse met">Sara</a> saw a tweet from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bartvandevel" title="Bart Van de Vel on twitter" rel="contact met">@BartVandeVel</a>, who needed a very last minute photographer for event photography during <a href="http://www.lunchbeat-belgium.be" title="Lunch beat Belgium" rel="contact met">Lunch beat</a>. I quickly responded and that&#8217;s how I ended up in <a href="http://www.thonhotels.com/hotels/countrys/belgium/brussels/thon-hotel-eu/" title="Hotel Thon EU, European District Brussels" rel="contact met">Hotel Thon</a> 2 hours later.

Lunch beat is a party with a DJ, food and non-alcoholic beverages during 1 hour over lunchtime in a fancy location. About 150-200 people went completely crazy and had loads of fun yesterday. It was great fun to watch and photograph.

Some of my photos also got published in some Belgian newspapers like HLN.be, La Derni&egrave;re Heure and Le Soir.
