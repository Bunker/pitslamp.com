Whenever <a href="http://www.saravdv.be/2013/02/04/nespresso-linizio-lungo/" title="Sara proeft Nespresso Linizio Lungo" rel="muse met">Sara</a> receives a new product to review on her blog. I'm the one taking the product shots. Mainly, because it allows me to play and experiment with new things.

Something I was thinking of trying since I saw it are <a href="http://annstreetstudio.com/category/cinemagraphs/" title="Cinemagraphs | Ann street photography" rel="contact">cinemagraphs invented by &#8220;From me to you&#8221;</a>. Cinemagraphs are photos but with subtle motion in. It fascinates me, so I tried it out myself.

Although I'm not yet where I want to be, I do like the results. I would like the motion to be more subtle, but I can tell you it's not easy creating these photos. If you want to do it with products it takes time and preparation. Anyway it's really fun to do and I'm sure there will be more product shots like these.
