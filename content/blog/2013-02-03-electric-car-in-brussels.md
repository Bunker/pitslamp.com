[![Electric car of ABB][1]](/images/blogposts/20121211_abb_autoworld-8281.jpg)

Once in a while, everything seems to work out, just as you hoped. This was the case when <a href="http://www.abb.be" rel="contact met" title="ABB">ABB</a> asked me to shoot an event featuring their electric car in the Jubelpark in Brussels.

The Nissan Leaf had just been cleaned, the location was gorgeous and the evening sun was casting a marvelous light on the arc. The only thing I could think of was, putting the car in a good position and start shooting. The only thing that could go wrong, would have been when the law passed by.

A quick edit in Lightroom and you get a result, that not only pleases your client, but also gives you a nice portfolio image. That's all it takes sometimes.
