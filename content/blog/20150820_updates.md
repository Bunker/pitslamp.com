![Beach Nieuwpoort floating sand][11]

I finally got around of setting back everything like it used to be on the site, while I was doing that, I decided to split off all film photography related things, add some pages, setup some promos and add a new payment method. 

So let me give you an overview:

* New intro text on the [homepage][1]
* New tagline, "I shoot people" is no longer fitting for my brand. 
* Removed the, never read, about page and restyled the contact page
* Added 2 new menu-items, [Workshops][2] and [Actions][3]
* Moved fine-art portraits to [bunkens.be][4] (under construction atm)
* Added [product portfolio][8]
* Announced [3 workshops][6] in the coming months
* Announced [bitcoin payments][7]
* Made a page for the [polaroid photo booth][8]
* Announced a permanent reduction for [Ingress resistance members][9]
* Announced a new "I shoot, you decide" and renamed it ["Pay what you want"][10]

More bugfixes and features on the website will be coming soon, but these were the most important.

It took a lot more time then expected because of another new development in my life. I became a parent at the end of July and it's amazing how much time such a little human can take up.
