When you take on the challenge of photographing with 3 different cameras, you encounter a couple of obstacles. So let me show you some of the problems I had to solve before shooting.

The first and most important one is how to shoot with 3 different cameras. I had to setup a system to switch out the cameras and see if everything was still working. It was a hassle, but with some pockets and shoulder straps, you can keep all cameras with you at all time.

The most challenging was figuring out how to sync my off camera flashes with the different cameras. Off course with the Pocket wizards I have, that was no problem for the 5D mk II. On the Samsung NX100 I had to switch a setting to have it trigger the pocketwizard without using the TTL. So that was not a real problem eiter. But how was I going to trigger the flashes with the Nokia N8. It has a flash so optical slaves was kind of a no brainer. But that gave me another problem, the flash in the n8 has a pre-flash, which triggered the flashes before the photo was made. Luckily my bowens Gemini 500R have a custom setting where you can set the number of pre flashes.

An other problem was that with the N8 you can't use manual mode, so that you are not working with the same settings all the time. To solve this, I had to turn the exposure compensation all the way down. This gave me some more control over the final photo.

At last I also had to figure out a way to mount the n8 to a tripod. I does not have a tripod mount, so I used a bungee ball to attach it to the handle of my manfrotto head.

Overall the problems were quite easy to solve, but they required some preparations and extensive testing at home to circumvent all the above problems.

I will not shoot any work for clients with a cellphone, just because I can. It is just a lot easier to shoot with a pro DSLR. But my goal was to prove that you can't use the excuse that you don't have to appropriate equipment for making great photos.
