Everybody tells me that becoming 30 is a huge deal, so I wanted to do something huge to celebrate that. It took me a year to come up with an idea. But last friday it hit me. That&#8217;s when **project 30-30-30-30** was born.

So what is project 30-30-30-30. It&#8217;s a fairly simple concept: I&#8217;ll photograph 30 people during a shoot of 30 minutes each, I&#8217;ll use 30 cameras during the day and will shoot 30 photos of each person. <a href="http://muasophiesegers.wordpress.com/" title="MUA Sophie Segers" rel="contact met">Sophie Segers</a> will be there to provide those who wish with some make-up.

Do you want to be part of this unique concept and maybe get photographed in the process, join me and the crew this Saturday 21/04 at Bar Buro in Ghent.
