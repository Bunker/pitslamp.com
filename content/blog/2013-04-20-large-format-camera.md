Since I started in photography, there has been one type of camera that I wanted, a large format camera. There always have been reasons not to buy the camera, first I didn't do any film. Since I shoot film, I haven't found any kit for an affordable price until a week or 2 ago. On a local classified site, I found a very affordable 4&#215;5 view camera.

A view camera is to a normal camera like a hand drill is to table drill for a carpenter. You can make great pictures with any camera, but with a view camera you can just do that bit more. I love this camera for taking portraits.

As you can see in the package I bought there was also a pack Polaroid included and I already had loads of fun with it.
