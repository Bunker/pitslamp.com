This above photo is made as a concept for a contest organized by Nespresso. My girlfriend <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" title="There are no endings, only new beginnings" rel="muse met">Sara</a> wanted to participate in this contest and so we made this picture on a saturday evening in our living room. She won the contest by the way.

The technical side of this camera was not too hard, we just had to work out a way to loose highlights on the wall and the frame of the mirror. This because our living room consisted out of the all white walls and a white ceiling. I used 2 studio flashes, one with a softbox and one with a selfmade snoot.
