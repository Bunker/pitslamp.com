![Conversity Model, the book][1]

A couple of months ago, <a href="http://www.conversity.be" rel="friend met" title="Conversity model">Clo Willaerts</a> decided to write a book about earning money with social media. Because she was working under a very tight time limit, she asked experts to write a piece related to social media in their area of expertise. That's when <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bnox" title="Bnox on Twitter" rel="friend met">Clo</a> contacted me to write a piece on profile pictures.

In January I wrote a piece on the subject on my dutch counterpart of this blog. Now, I've translated this article so that you can read what I wrote in the book. You can find it under the title <a href="http://www.pitslamp.com/blog/20110104_profielfoto" title="Profile pictures, an art in itself" rel="me">Profile pictures, an art.&#8221;</a>.

I've read the book myself and although I'm quite adapt at social media myself, I still learned a lot from the book. If you want to buy the book, there are several options available, it's in the bookstores since wednesday 16/03/2011 or you can find it at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Conversity-Model-ebook/dp/B004P8JX6K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;m=A36UWAQAV1U1MD&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1300441839&#038;sr=8-1" title="conversity model in the Amazon store" rel="contact met">amazon.com</a>. At amazon you can buy either the paper version or the kindle version.
