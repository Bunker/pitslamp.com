[![iMinds advertising photo][1]](/images/blogposts/68057_10151197199929127_202644223_n.jpg)

In October the independent research facility IBBT changed it's name to <a href="http://www.iminds.be" title="iMinds" rel="contact met">iMinds</a>. They hired me to do some advertising photography for the resulting campaign.

This image was shot on a green key and extracted in Photoshop so it could be used in the design.
