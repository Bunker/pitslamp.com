The &#8220;I shoot, you decide&#8221; package contains:

  * A black and white fotoshoot (portrait, family, couple,&#8230;)
  * on location (at home, work, in the park, â€¦)
  * A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_print" title="Contact print on wikipedia" rel="none">contact print</a> with all the photos
  * 1 handmade and signed darkroom print in a size of 50x60cm on quality paper.
