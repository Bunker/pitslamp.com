Over a year ago I started to shoot with analog cameras and I really enjoy it, as you maybe already noticed on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pitslamp" title="PitsLamp on twitter" rel="me">twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pitslamp" title="PitsLamp Photography on Facebook" rel="me">facebook</a>. Since January I also have a blog about film photography, you can find it at <a href="http://www.talesonfilm.com" title="Tales on film: analog photography is not dead" rel="contact met">talesonfilm.com</a>.

Everybody interested in film photography make sure to check it out. But also everybody that wants to have a shoot on film, don't hesitate to <a href="http://www.pitslamp.com/contact" title="Contact | PitsLamp Photography" rel="me">contact</a> me for a quote.
