[![Nespresso Kazaar and Dharkan packshot][1]](/images/blogposts/20130923_nespresso_dharkan_kazaar-6398.jpg)

As you probably know by now, my girlfriend <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" title="Saravdv.be: There are no endings, only new beginnings" rel="muse spouse">Sara</a> receives a lot of review products for her blog. As she has a photographer around, she hands of the photography to me. If I have the time, I do like to play around a bit with techniques I haven't used before. Especially if the subject is new tastes from <a href="http://www.nespresso.be" title="De kunst van Espresso, exclusieve koffie en koffiemachines | Nespresso | Nespresso" rel="contact met">Nespresso</a>, mainly because I live on coffee.

Although I'm not a big fan of most Nespresso tastes, but the new, previously limited, kazaar and dharkan tastes I do love. Nespresso has a great brand and always uses great photography. Every time I do a shoot with Nespresso capsules, I try to interpret the brand and the tastes as I see it. On the Nespresso intensity scale, Kazaar and Dharkan, are respectively 12 and 11 and so they are of the scale. I tried to show this in the photos.

Next to the above, I also wanted to use fluids moved by the vibrations of music from a speaker. This made for the perfect combination to play around. So free afternoon, my inspiration, 1 song on repeat and a huge amount of coffee, resulted in the following images.

Hit me with your comments. Also if anybody from Nespresso reads this, you can book me if you like these.
