Last august, I was on the road for 3 days shooting on several locations for ABB. They wanted to update their service brochure with new photos. We went to shoot at the harbour of Rotterdam, a service labo and more. It was an unique experience, I could go and shoot at some locations where you normally would have not been able to come.

Not only was it an unique experience, but it was also very challenging to shoot during 3 days on several locations in the Netherlands and Belgium. I had strict guidelines to shoot in the house style. It is very rewarding to see that the most photos got used in the brochure as is.

The photos in this post are the originals and you can find them also in the <a href='http://pitslamp.com/?attachment_id=477' rel='attachment wp-att-477'>Service Benelux brochure 2012</a>
