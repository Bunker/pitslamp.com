When I got some expired large format (4&#215;5 inch) Polaroid film from <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/helenavaneykeren" title="Helena Van Eyckeren op linked in" rel="friend met">Helena</a>, I immediately wanted to experiment with it. Sadly enough I don't have a large format camera, but I know people that do.

After a bit of texting back and forth, I met up with <a href="http://www.ianbauters.be" title="Ian Bauters" rel="contact met">Ian</a> and his Toyo 4&#215;5 large format camera. We set out to create some large format portraits in the city centre of Ghent. It took all our combined film photography knowledge, but we managed to get some usable portraits.

We wanted to have everything ready before we started taking portraits of passers by, so off course I had to be the subject, as you can see at the top of this article. After we got it all working, we started to ask strangers to pose for a portrait, Ellen was so kind to help us out. Although the print is a bit light, because of the unpredictable expired film, I still like it. It may well be that it's only because it was my first time using a large format camera.

Anyway the experiment was a success and I have something new to add to my wishlist. I really want to have and use one of those cameras.

**Although not yet with a large format camera, take your chance to book an analogue portrait shoot. You get a signed large darkroom print and decide afterwards what it's worth to you: <a href="http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130106_i-shoot-you-decide-ii-large-portrait" title="I shoot, you decide: large portrait" rel="me">More info</a>**
