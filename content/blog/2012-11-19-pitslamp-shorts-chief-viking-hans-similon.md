The last couple of months I'm shooting editorial portraits for the direct marketing magazine <a href="http://www.dmix.be" title="DMIX" rel="contact met">DMIX</a>. Most of the portraits I'm shooting are for the ongoing series &#8220;The future bites&#8221;, in this series, young upcoming marketeers are interviewed.

One of the people I photographed for such an article was <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hanssim" title="Hans Similon on twitter" rel="contact met">Hans Similon</a>, who's title is Chief Viking for the MVNO <a href="http://www.mobilevikings.com" title="Mobile Vikings" rel="contact met">Mobile Vikings</a>. Hans is a very easy going person with an open mind towards photos. I really enjoyed photographing him

As offices aren't the most attractive environments for a creative photo, I always try to use something extra. In this photo we used some of the attributes Mobile Vikings has around the office, like the chair and the billiard table.
