As you may know, our belgian king Albert II announced his abdication and he will be handing his crown to prince Filip. Coincidentally that happens to be my name, so to celebrate me becoming king, I launched the &#8220;I&#8217;ll be king promotion&#8221;.

You&#8217;ll get the following package for only **199 euro** (incl. VAT), normal price is 399 euro (incl. VAT).

  * Portrait shoot on black and white film (portrait, family, boudoir, pet, engagement, pregnancy, etc)
  * 1 handmade wet print of 50&#215;60 cm
  * 3 handmade wet prints of 24&#215;30 cm
  * Digital scans of the photos

The promotion is valid until the 21st of july, when prince Filip will be king.
