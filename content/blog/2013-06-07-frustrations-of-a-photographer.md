As I already mentioned in my previous post <a href="http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130531_what-does-a-photographer-cost" title="Wat kost een fotograaf? : PitsLamp Fotografie" rel="me">What does a photographer cost?</a> I'm writing a series about the frustrations of a photographer. In this post I'll be talking about things that annoy me when sending quotes or receiving certain request from clients.

I made a small list with my most common frustrations and I also explain why I think these are frustrating, annoying or even insulting.

**Disclaimer:** I do not mean to offend anyone, but if you feel offend, accept my apologies in advance.

### Can you make a photo report, we'll give you free tickets

This request is one of the reasons, I started this series of articles

My job as a photographer is to create photos, during an assignment I'm focused on that task and I can't really be part of whatever else is happening during the party/conference/show/award ceremony. So I'm sorry but tickets aren't very useful.

Although it can be a really interesting subject for you and others, the subject probably is outside my area of expertise and doesn't really connect with me.

### You'll get photo credits.

This seems to be the golden ticket for a lot of companies/magazines/newspapers/&#8230;, it doens't matter if the photos will be used in a commercial or non-commercial publication. The logic being that it's an honor as a photographer to be published. It may very well be that I think it's an honor to be published, but that doesn't mean I don't want to get paid for the work I do/did.

My credo is, if I do something for free it's my decision. If there is any money involved (entrance, sponsoring, advertising purposes, &#8230;), I'm not doing it for free or credit.

### Our budget is limited to xxx

This is usually a reply after receiving a quote, meaning: Can't you do the same work for less money. I'm really sorry but I can't, have a look at my previous post <a href="http://pitslamp.com/blog/20130531_what-does-a-photographer-cost" title="Wat kost een fotograaf? : PitsLamp Fotografie" rel="me">What does a photographer cost?</a>. However, what I can do for your budget is adjust the quote and reduce the workload.

### We'll need to photos by tomorrow morning xxam.

A question that always follows at the end of an assignment and wasn't mentioned at the time of the quote. Off course that's possible, but it does cost more because it does require a lot more effort.

For example delivery by the next morning, means I have to process everything during the night and it does happen quite often I'm working till 3-4am to get everything delivered on time.

This also means, I have to adjust my planning for the next day. If I know before the assignment that I have to process everything the same day, I can take that into account when planning.

Everything is possible, but I would prefer to know about it beforehand.

### We would like every photo you took.

This one I do hear less and less, but it still happens. Sending you all photos isn't possible. A good photo is a process of improving the previous photos. In the end a client only cares about the great photos, that can be published, there is no use to deliver every photo.

This is something every decent photographer will confirm. It only hurts my image as a photographer.

### Our payment terms are xx

As a freelancer it's not easy to have a decent cashflow, if clients decide to pay whenever pleases them, a cashflow is none existing. It can't be that hard to wire money, can it?

I can continue for a bit, but I think I covered the most important ones.

**The next post in this series will be about the remarks a photographer receives**
