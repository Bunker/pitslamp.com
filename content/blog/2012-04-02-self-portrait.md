Today my motivation for work is kinda low, because of all kinds of creative ideas floating around in my head. So I decided to just play for an hour.

The skylight in our living room catches quite a lot of sun and whenever the sun is coming through it, I tend to stop for a moment and enjoy the sun on my face. That gave me the idea, to shoot a adoration picture of myself enjoying the sun.
