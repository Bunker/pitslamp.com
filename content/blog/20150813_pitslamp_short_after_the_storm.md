![Mal√©ves-Sainte-Marie-Wastines after the thunderstorm][1]

Like a lot of photographers, I went outside into the thunderstorm to try and make some lightning shots. This time I did not manage to capture anything useful, that'll be for next time, when I'm better prepared. 

![Hay drying][2]

As you can see in the photos above I managed to capture a rather interesting photo afterwards when the thunderstorm had passed and the rain was evaporating under a pastel sunset.
