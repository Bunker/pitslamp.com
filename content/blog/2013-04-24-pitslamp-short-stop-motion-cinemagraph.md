[![stop motion cinemagraph nespresso][1]](/images/blogposts/nespresso_trieste_napoli.gif)

I like stop motion, but it takes a lot of time. <a href="http://www.saravdv.be" title="SaraVdV: there are no endings, only new beginnings" rel="muse friend met">Sara</a> needed some photos of the limited edition Napoli and Trieste of Nespresso and off course I'm the one making those. However having spend way too much time working at the computer lately, I decided to do something fun and combine a cinemagraph and stop motion, 2 things I love, but rarely get around to doing. After about an hour, this is the result. Enjoy
