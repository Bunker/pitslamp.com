First of all, a happy New Year to all of you.

During last month I launched a little project, some of you might know this, for the others, here is a short sitwrap. I proposed a shoot on black and white film with as a result 2 a5 and 1 a4 print. After seeing the result, the client got to decide what all this is worth to them.

At announcement and during the month of december I got asked to share the results. So here it goes

The project ran from the 24th november till the 24th of december. During this period I received 4 bookings, here are some facts about the clients.

  * 3 knew me before the project
  * 1 found my action through facebook
  * 1 couple, 2 sisters, 1 family and 1 portraitshoot
  * 20 to 30 photos per shoot

The question I heard the most was: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to cut in your own flesh with this project?&#8221; Here are the numbers

  * 2 to 3 times transport, 2h of shoots and at least 2h darkroom work
  * Cost of the material for every shoot: 50 euro
  * Normal price: 200 to 250 euro
  * Average amount payed per shoot: 190 euro
  * Average extra order: 75 euro
  * Average total amount per shoot: 265 euro

As the results show, the perceived value of the shoot is very close to the price I put on the shoot. I&#8217;m satisfied with the results and had loads of fun working with these clients.

Due to the success I&#8217;ll repeat the I shoot, you decide project again at certain points in time. Every time the package will change a bit. Follow here for more info.
