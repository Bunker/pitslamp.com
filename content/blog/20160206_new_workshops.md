[![Veronique portrait][11]](/images/blogposts/20130606_mamiyaRB67_shoot_veronique-10.jpg)

Today I'm announcing new workshops. As there is some interest in film photography and/or darkroom, I've setup 3 workshops during the following months.

The workshops will be available in either English, Dutch and/or French. They will be held in my personal darkroom in Sart-Risbart in Brabant-Wallon, at 20 minutes from Brussels, Leuven and Namen. 

For the workshops with photography, we are located in a picturesque village in the countryside and there will be time to go outside to take pictures.

If you are interested go check the dates and specifics over at my [Workshops page][1]
