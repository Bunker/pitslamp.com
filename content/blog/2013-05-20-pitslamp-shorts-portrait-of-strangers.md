In the beginning of april, I went out with <a href="http://www.nowforever.be" title="Huwelijk and event photography Stijn Vandenbussche" rel="friend met">Stijn</a> to photograph some strangers, while Stijn used his digital camera, I took 2 photos, 1 polaroid to give to the people and one for myself on black and white film.

It was a test in efficiency, I wanted to capture the person in just one photo, nothing more, nothing less. It did not work out every time, but I love the result in the photo above.

Also read Stijn's report of the day: <a href="http://nowforever.be/improve-communication-skills-shoot-a-stranger/" title="Nowforever Photography: Improve communication skills, shoot a stranger" rel="friend met">Improve communication skills, shoot a stranger</a>
