It took more then a year, but <a href="http://www.tomvh.be" title="Tom Vander Heyden" rel="friend met">Tom</a>, a very talented sports photographer, finally made it to our house.

We have a rule that everybody who comes by the house has to be photographed on some kind of a polaroid, so we did a quick portrait in the garden
