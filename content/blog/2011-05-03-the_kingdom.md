A couple of weeks ago, Sony gave me a alpha 900 to test during some weeks. As is becoming a habit lately I&#8217;m not very into reviewing the technical aspects or comparing it to other cameras. Instead I try the camera in a real life situation.

I&#8217;ve been looking into a making a stop-motion video for some time now. So this was the perfect opportunity to try this out.

I didn&#8217;t want to make just any stop-motion, but do it as a kind of a video clip for a song with a meaning. So I chose The kingdom of <a href="http://www.milow.com" title="milow" rel="contact met">Milow</a>. A number about the current political situation in Belgium

Have a look at the result below. Just to be clear it is not the official video of The Kingdom.

[Proof of concept: Milow &#8211; The Kingdom][1] from [PitsLamp][2] on [Vimeo][3].

It took me 13 hours to make the video and couldn&#8217;t have done it without the help of my great girlfriend. Also I asked and got permission of Milow to use his song in this video, which I&#8217;m very grateful for.
