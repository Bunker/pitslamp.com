Those that have met me during the last 5 year have probably seen the &#8220;Pitsmobiel&#8221;. It was a black Citro&euml;n Berlingo, as it was a lease for 5 year, the lease ended yesterday. I already received my new &#8220;Pitsmobiel&#8221; a Ford Focus last saturday, so I decided to do a little photoshoot. 

I asked my intern/assistant <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ilja.Vladimirovitsj.Photography" title="Ilja Vladimirovitsj Photography on Facebook" rel="contact met friend">Ilja</a> to stay till dark and with some more help, we created this photo with only 5 speedlights and a long exposure.
