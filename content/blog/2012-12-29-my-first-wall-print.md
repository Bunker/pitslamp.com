[![Wall print by PitsLamp Photography][1]](/images/blogposts/20121228_Large_Print-8742.jpg)

During last month I sold my first piece of furniture. I know I'm a photographer but a printed photo in a size of 1&#215;1.5 meters is no longer a simple print, it's a piece of furniture. To be honest I still am very impressed with the result

The photo is printed by an UV-printer on a aluminum sheet of 1mm attached to 3mm dibond. Because the whites in the photo are not printed, the aluminum reflects light and the landscape looks to be alive.

**From now on, everybody can order prints like this, with or without a shoot, just <a href="http://www.pitslamp.com/contact" rel="me" title="PitsLamp Photography | Contact">contact me</a>**
