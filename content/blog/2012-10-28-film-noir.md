Sometimes you need to challenge yourself and get outside of that comfort zone. I always liked the look of film noir very much, it&#8217;s dramatic, dark and is beautiful for both genders. It also works marvelous in black and white which is perfect for my portraits on film.

When I tried to create look for the first time during a sweet summer evening, I couldn&#8217;t get the perfect look. So I asked <a href="http://www.nowforever.be" title="Huwelijk event en Fashion Photography" rel="friend met">Stijn</a> to help me figure out what I was doing wrong and pose for me.

We used a speedlight with a long snoot and another one almost completely blacked out.

I think I can say, successful test and another lighting trick in the bag.
