Sometimes you need to challenge yourself and get outside of that comfort zone. I always liked the look of film noir very much, it's dramatic, dark and is beautiful for both genders. It also works marvelous in black and white which is perfect for my portraits on film.

When I tried to create look for the first time during a sweet summer evening, I couldn't get the perfect look. So I asked <a href="http://www.nowforever.be" title="Huwelijk event en Fashion Photography" rel="friend met">Stijn</a> to help me figure out what I was doing wrong and pose for me.

We used a speedlight with a long snoot and another one almost completely blacked out.

I think I can say, successful test and another lighting trick in the bag.
