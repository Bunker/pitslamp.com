**Because of different visions, we have parted ways and I'm no longer a part of Stijlhard.**

<a href="http://pitslamp.com/blog/20120102_happy-newyear/stijlwanted-2" rel="attachment wp-att-413"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/STIJLWANTED1.jpg" alt="" title="STIJLWANTED" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-413" /></a>

2011 has been a mad year for me and I guess and hope 2012 will be even more crazy. The biggest thing that happened in 2011 is that together we Dimitri Janssens and Steven Janssens we decided to join our specialities and we formed <a href="http://www.stijlhard.com" title="Stijlhard" rel="contact met">Stijlhard</a>.

Stijlhard is an agency for everything concept and image related. We do video, photography, graphic design. We start with your idea, convert it into a concept and realize it into an end product. For more info go and checkout <a href="http://www.stijlhard.com" title="Stijlhard" rel="contact met">our website</a>.

As for my blog, I'll try to post more regularly, so that you all can stay update on what's going on at the PitsLamp offices. I'm planning to rock 2012 with my existing and new customers.
