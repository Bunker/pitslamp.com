Lately I'm photographing on a regular basis for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/albertheijnbelgie" title="Fan page Albert Heijn BE on Facebook" rel="contact met">Albert Heijn</a> in Brasschaat. That was what I intended to do yesterday too.

But apparently I had a off day, because I forgot my memory cards at home. Now Albert Heijn is not exactly around the corner for me, so driving back to get my cards was no option. Luckily a good friend of mine lives around the corner and he was willing to bring me a new card.

Off course the assignment had already started and I was still standing there unable to work, since a couple of weeks I have a film camera in my bag, always loaded with film. So after a call with the client, I decided to start the assignment on film.

In the end it all worked out and I learned 2 valuable lessons, first of all always have a back-up card in your car. Second whatever happens, you can still finish the assignment, it might be more difficult but it's possible.
