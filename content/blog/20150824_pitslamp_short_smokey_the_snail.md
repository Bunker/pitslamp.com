![Smoke and the baby snail][1]

Sometimes everything comes together as if it is meant to be. I was researching small smoke machines on the internet when the baby snail showed up in one of our flowers inside the house. So I decided to test some things.

And about an hour later, this happened, the smoke replicated the image of the baby snail.

The photos were made with an iPhone as lighting and the smoke from an e-cigarette (no nicotine) on our coffee table. 

_Disclaimer: no baby snails were harmed in the making of these photos._
