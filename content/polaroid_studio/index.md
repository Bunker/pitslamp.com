## Traditional polaroids ##

The polaroids are traditional photo paper, I don't use digital prints to simulate the effect. The photos are unique, retro and there is only one copy.

## Branding ##

The polaroids can be inserted in a branded frame, can be branded by putting a custom background. 60 seconds after shooting, the polaroids are ready to be delivered, they can be presented on a clothing line or handed out.

## Social media ##

If you want to upload the photos we can setup a digital camera that shoots simultaneously a digital photo of the exact same setup at the same time. 

These uploads can be near instant, we can upload to your website, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, 500px and many more...
